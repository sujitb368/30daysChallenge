### What is threading?

- Threading is a programming technique that allows multiple tasks to be executed concurrently. This is done by creating multiple threads, each of which can run independently of the others. Threads can be used to improve the performance of applications by allowing them to take advantage of multiple CPU cores.

### difference between multi threading and single threaded

1. **Single Threading:**

   - **Sequential Execution:** In a single-threaded program, tasks are executed sequentially, one after the other. The program executes one task, completes it, and then moves on to the next task.

   - **Limited Concurrency:** Single-threaded programs can only perform one task at a time, even on multi-core processors. While one task is running, all other tasks have to wait, which can lead to slower performance for applications that perform multiple operations simultaneously.

   - **Simplicity:** Single-threaded programming is often simpler and easier to reason about because there are no concerns about thread synchronization, race conditions, and other complexities associated with multi-threading.

   - **Example:** JavaScript running in a web browser is primarily single-threaded, where the main thread handles tasks like rendering, user interactions, and executing JavaScript code.

2. **Multi-Threading:**

   - **Concurrent Execution:** In a multi-threaded program, multiple threads run independently and can execute tasks concurrently. Each thread has its own stack and can execute code simultaneously with other threads.

   - **Enhanced Concurrency:** Multi-threading allows a program to take advantage of multi-core processors effectively. It can perform multiple tasks at the same time, which can lead to improved performance for multi-threaded applications.

   - **Complexity:** Multi-threaded programming can be complex because threads can run concurrently, potentially leading to race conditions, deadlocks, and synchronization issues. Careful management of shared resources is required to ensure data integrity.

   - **Example:** Many server applications, such as web servers and database servers, use multi-threading to handle multiple client requests simultaneously. Operating systems also use multi-threading to manage various system tasks.
