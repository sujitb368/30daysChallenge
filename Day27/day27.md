### Difference between high level and low level language

**High-Level Language:**

1. **Abstraction:** High-level languages provide a high level of abstraction, closer to human language and are easier to read and write.

2. **Portability:** Programs written in high-level languages are generally more portable because they are less tied to a specific hardware architecture or operating system. They can be executed on different platforms with minimal modification.

3. **Ease of Use:** High-level languages are user-friendly and promote productivity. They offer built-in data structures and high-level constructs like loops, conditionals, and functions, making it easier to express complex algorithms.

4. **Execution Speed:** High-level languages are generally slower in terms of execution speed compared to low-level languages because they often involve layers of abstraction and translation.

**Low-Level Language:**

1. **Abstraction:** Low-level languages are closer to the hardware and provide little to no abstraction. They involve a one-to-one correspondence with machine instructions and memory locations.

2. **Portability:** Programs written in low-level languages are less portable because they are closely tied to the hardware architecture. Code needs to be rewrite different platforms.

3. **Ease of Use:** Low-level languages are more challenging to work with as they require manual memory management and deal with low-level hardware details. They are less user-friendly and less expressive.

4. **Execution Speed:** Low-level languages can result in faster execution speeds because they provide direct control over hardware resources.
